## What Have I been up to?

My last github profile locked me out due to losing access to 2FA on an old cellphone.

I am starting this new account to document the project that I am working on, software, hardware and otherwise.

I am starting my journey to move from networking into application security.

My first project will be to set up a RHEL headless server (hypervisor) in my home lab and then to place a KALI Vm within it.

In March I will begin to study for the linux + to dive deeper into linux and to also renew my sec+.
